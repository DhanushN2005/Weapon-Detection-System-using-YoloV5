# 🔫 Weapon Detection System (Real-Time)

A real-time weapon detection system built using YOLOv5, OpenCV, and PyTorch.

The system detects weapons such as guns and knives from a live camera feed and can be extended for surveillance and security applications.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 Real-time weapon detection using webcam / IP camera
- 🧠 Deep Learning–based object detection (YOLOv5)
- ⚡ Fast inference with PyTorch
- 📦 Lightweight and modular codebase
- 🔒 Suitable for surveillance & safety systems

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- Computer Vision
